# Updating T3 Code

The app you use and the server running your agents can be on different machines.
When a server is behind your web or desktop app, an update notice appears in the
conversation and **Settings → Connections**. Update the machine named in that
notice.

## Before you update

Server updates restart the connection and can interrupt active agents and
terminal commands. Saved threads, settings, and project files remain.

**Settings → General → Continue threads after restarts** is off by default.
Enable it to resume supported active threads after an update, crash, or machine
restart. Changes are saved to connected environments that support this setting;
update older servers first. If a supported environment was offline or has a
different value, use **Apply to all** in Settings after it connects.
T3 Code must start again on that machine;
the setting does not enable automatic startup. Terminal commands may still be
interrupted, and threads without saved provider resume state need a new message.
If you previously enabled continuation for updates, enable this setting once
to allow recovery without a connected client.

## Update a connected server

The offered action depends on how the server runs:

| Action                     | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Update server**          | Keep the client open while it installs and reconnects. Supported background services update remotely. For a desktop-hosted server, this also closes and relaunches the desktop app on the host. |
| **Update the desktop app** | Update the desktop app on the machine running the server, then reopen it if needed.                                                                                                             |
| **Copy update command**    | Stop the command-line server on its host and relaunch with the copied command, keeping your usual startup options.                                                                              |

The update does not remove saved threads, settings, or project files.

Updates from the previous orchestration system preserve conversation transcripts but cannot carry
every kind of runtime history forward. Read [Threads from older T3 Code versions](./thread-migration.md)
before continuing an important older thread.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Update server**          | Available for the T3 Code Linux background service and for servers run by a current T3 Code desktop app. Select the button and leave T3 Code open while it downloads, installs, restarts, and reconnects. For desktop-app servers this closes and relaunches the desktop app on that machine. If installation fails, the desktop app stays open and reconnects to its server. |
| **Update the desktop app** | Shown for desktop apps that predate remote updates. Open the T3 Code desktop app on the machine that runs the server and install the app update there. Reopen it if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Copy update command**    | Copy the command, open a terminal on the server machine, stop the current T3 Code server, and relaunch it with the copied command and any startup options you normally use.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The available action depends on how that server was started. T3 Code does not update connected
servers silently in the background.

An older background-service launcher may ask you to run the exact
`npx t3@<version> service update` command on the server machine. That one local update installs the
rollback support needed for later remote updates, including versions that change the database.

After selecting **Update**, the notice becomes a live status line: **Downloading…** while the new
version is fetched and verified, then **Restarting…** while the server restarts into it. The same
status appears in the conversation and in Connections, so navigating between them does not lose the
update. A failure remains visible with its error and an option to retry.

**Copy update command** gives you `npx t3@<client-version>`, which relaunches the server directly
at the matching version. Add whatever startup options you normally use.

If the server instead runs as the T3 Code background service, update the service on the host and
pin the same version:

```sh
npx t3@<client-version> service update
```

Replace `<client-version>` with the version shown in the notice. Using
`@latest` only resolves the mismatch if your client is on that release. An older
service launcher may require this local update before it supports remote updates
and rollback.

For a foreground server, the copied command is `npx t3@<client-version>`. Add
`serve` if you normally run without a browser, and preserve options such as
`--host` or `--tailscale-serve`. See
[background services](./background-service.md) for service management.

## If an update fails

Keep the client open until it reconnects or reports a failure. A failed service
update can roll back to the previous version. If the update still fails:

1. Retry the offered action once.
2. Check that you updated the server's machine, not only the device you are using.
3. For a command-line server, stop it and relaunch the exact version shown in the notice.

## Mobile updates

Install App Store or Google Play releases as usual. The mobile app can also
download updates in the background and apply them when you next leave the app.
It saves drafts and queued messages before restarting. If you keep the app open
for a long time, it may ask to install immediately; choosing **Later** leaves the
update queued for the next suitable moment.
